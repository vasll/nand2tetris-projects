# nand2tetris-projects

My completed projects from the [nand2tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org) part I 

A few repetitive components were implemented in the nand2tetris.circ file using [logisim evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) instead of the provided HDL language

You can find the hack assembler from project 06 as a separate project in my [hassembler repo](https://github.com/vasll/hassembler)
